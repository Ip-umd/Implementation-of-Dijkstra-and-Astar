# Implementation-of-Dijkstra-and-Astar

Files included:

I. Dijkstra_point

II. Dijkstra_rigid

III. A*_point

IV. A*_rigid

Libraries used:
numpy, matplotlib, math and heapq



Instructions:

1. For files Dijkstra_point and A*_point , the user need to input:
     Start point and Goal point.
     Start point and Goal point are integer inputs.

2. For files Dijkstra_rigid and A*_rigid , the user need to input:
     Start point ,Goal point, Robot radius, Clearance
     Start point and Goal point are integer inputs.
     Robot radius and Clearance are float inputs.

3.  Resolution has been considered one for all the codes.
